inhabited previously for a few centuries.\nUrkesh was an ally of the Akkadian Empire through what is believed to have been a dynastic marriage tradition. Tar'am-Agade the daughter of the Akkadian king, Naram-Sin, is believed to have been married to the king of Urkesh. During the early second millennium BCE the city passed into the hands of the rulers of Mari, a city a few hundred miles to the south. The king of Urkesh became a vassal (and apparently an appointed puppet) of Mari. The people of Urkesh evidently resented this, as the royal archives at Mari provide evidence of their strong resistance; in one letter, the king of Mari tells his Urkesh counterpart that \"I did not know that the sons of your city hate you on my account. But you are mine, even if the city of Urkesh is not.\" In the middle of the millennium, Tell Mozan was the location of a Mitanni religious site. The city appears to have been largely abandoned circa 1350 BCE, but the reason for this is unknown to archaeologists at this time."}},{"type":"Feature","id":157,"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[40.070074120000072,36.841514830000051]},"properties":{"OBJECTID":157,"Name":"Washukanni","FolderPath":"Ancient Locations/Ancient Locations (4283 placemarks and overlays)/Mesopotamia","PopupInfo":""}},{"type":"Feature","id":158,"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[42.352065760000073,36.340391830000044]},"properties":{"OBJECTID":158,"Name":"Yarim Teppe I","FolderPath":"Ancient Locations/Ancient Locations (4283 placemarks and overlays)/Mesopotamia","PopupInfo":""}},{"type":"Feature","id":159,"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[42.348336420000066,36.337791480000078]},"properties":{"OBJECTID":159,"Name":"Yarim Teppe II","FolderPath":"Ancient Locations/Ancient Locations (4283 placemarks and overlays)/Mesopotamia","PopupInfo":""}},{"type":"Feature","id":160,"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[38.379104090000055,36.971459150000044]},"properties":{"OBJECTID":160,"Name":"Yatirtepe Höyük","FolderPath":"Ancient Locations/Ancient Locations (4283 placemarks and overlays)/Mesopotamia","PopupInfo":""}},{"type":"Feature","id":161,"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[39.65700116000005,37.310792390000074]},"properties":{"OBJECTID":161,"Name":"Yollarbasi ?","FolderPath":"Ancient Locations/Ancient Locations (4283 placemarks and overlays)/Mesopotamia","PopupInfo":""}},{"type":"Feature","id":162,"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[38.904584960000079,36.847620630000051]},"properties":{"OBJECTID":162,"Name":"Yukaribegdes","FolderPath":"Ancient Locations/Ancient Locations (4283 placemarks and overlays)/Mesopotamia","PopupInfo":""}},{"type":"Feature","id":163,"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[39.842344070000024,35.668186610000078]},"properties":{"OBJECTID":163,"Name":"Zalebiye","FolderPath":"Ancient Locations/Ancient Locations (4283 placemarks and overlays)/Mesopotamia","PopupInfo":""}},{"type":"Feature","id":164,"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[37.977754180000034,36.995804360000079]},"properties":{"OBJECTID":164,"Name":"Zeytinli Bahçe Höyük","FolderPath":"Ancient Locations/Ancient Locations (4283 placemarks and overlays)/Mesopotamia","PopupInfo":""}},{"type":"Feature","id":165,"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[35.476235770000073,23.910418570000047]},"properties":{"OBJECTID":165,"Name":"Berenice Troglodytica","FolderPath":"Ancient Locations/Ancient Locations (4283 placemarks and overlays)/Egypt/Settlements","PopupInfo":""}},{"type":"Feature","id":166,"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[31.00846088000003,29.541003330000024]},"properties":{"OBJECTID":166,"Name":"Bacchias ?","FolderPath":"Ancient Locations/Ancient Locations (4283 placemarks and overlays)/Egypt/Settlements","PopupInfo":""}},{"type":"Feature","id":167,"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[30.419210980000059,29.405564370000036]},"properties":{"OBJECTID":167,"Name":"Dionysias","FolderPath":"Ancient Locations/Ancient Locations (4283 placemarks and overlays)/Egypt/Settlements","PopupInfo":"Greco-Roman city."}},{"type":"Feature","id":168,"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[30.642164900000068,29.193414910000058]},"properties":{"OBJECTID":168,"Name":"Dja","FolderPath":"Ancient Locations/Ancient Locations (4283 placemarks and overlays)/Egypt/Settlements","PopupInfo":""}},{"type":"Feature","id":169,"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[30.543043820000037,29.37367493000005]},"properties":{"OBJECTID":169,"Name":"Euhemereia","FolderPath":"Ancient Locations/Ancient Locations (4283 placemarks and overlays)/Egypt/Settlements","PopupInfo":"Remains of this Graeco-Roman town include houses, a temple, granaries and two baths.

In the spring of 1883 Édouard Naville  believed he had identified it as the archaeological site Tell-el-Maskhuta. The site of Pithom, as identified by Naville, is to the east of Wadi Tumilat, south-west of Ismaïlia. Here was formerly a group of granite statues representing Ramesses II, two inscriptions naming Pr-Itm, storehouses and bricks made without straw. The excavations carried on by Naville for the Egypt Exploration Fund  uncovered a city wall, a ruined temple, and the remains of a series of brick buildings with very thick walls and consisting of rectangular chambers of various sizes, opening only at the top and without any entrances to one another. Naville identified it as being in the region of Tjeku, the capital of the 8th Lower Egypt nome. Excavations carried out over five seasons between 1978 and 1985 have shown that Tell el-Maskhuta dates only to the end of the 7th century, and may have been built by Pharaoh Necho II, possibly as part of his uncompleted canal building project from the Nile to the Gulf of

Construction started in or around Year 5 of his reign and was probably completed by Year 9, although it became the capital city two years earlier. To speed up construction of the city most of the buildings were constructed out of mud-brick, and white washed. The most important buildings were faced with local stone.\nIt is the only ancient Egyptian city which preserves great details of its internal plan, in large part because the city was abandoned after the death of Akhenaten. The city seems to have remained active for a decade or so after his death, and a shrine to Horemheb indicates that it was at least partially occupied at the beginning of his reign, if only as a source for building material elsewhere. Once it was abandoned it remained uninhabited until Roman settlement began along the edge of the Nile. However, due to the unique circumstances of its creation and abandonment, it is questionable how representative of ancient Egyptian cities it actually is. Akhetaten was hastily constructed and covered an area of approximately 13 km of territory on the east bank of the Nile River; on the west bank, land was set aside to provide crops for the city's population. The entire city was encircled with a total of 14 boundary stelae detailing Akhenaten's conditions for the establishment of this new capital city of

Identification and Description:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt lay West of Ai (Ge 12:8). It is named as on the northern border of Benjamin (the southern of Ephraim, Jos 16:2), at the top of the ascent from the Jordan valley by way of Ai (Jos 18:13). It lay South of Shiloh (Jud 21:19). Eusebius, Onomasticon places it 12 Roman miles from Jerusalem, on the road to Neapolis. It is represented by the modern Beitin, a village of some 400 inhabitants, which stands on a knoll East of the road to Nablus. There are four springs which yield supplies of good water. In ancient times these were supplemented by a reservoir hewn in the rock South of the town. The surrounding country is bleak and barren, the hills being marked by a succession of stony terraces, which may have suggested the form of the ladder in Jacob's famous dream.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e2. The Sanctuary:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe town was originally called Luz (Ge 28:19, etc.). When Jacob came hither on his way to Paddan-aram we are told that he lighted upon \"the place\" (Ge 28:11. Hebrew). The Hebrew maqom, like the cognate Arabic maqam, denotes a sacred place or sanctuary. The maqom was doubtless that at which Abraham had sacrificed, East of the town. In the morning Jacob set up \"for a pillar\" the stone which had served as his pillow (Ge 28:18; see PILLAR, matstsebhah), poured oil upon it and called the name of the place Bethel, \"house of God\"; that is, of God whose epiphany was for him associated with the pillar. This spot became a center of great interest, lending growing importance to the town. In process of time the name Luz disappeared, giving place to that of the adjoining sanctuary, town and sanctuary being identified. Jacob revisited the place on his return from Paddan-aram; here Deborah, Rebekah's nurse, died and was buried under \"the oak\" (Ge 35:6 f). Probably on rising ground East of Bethel Abraham and Lot stood to view the uninviting highlands and the rich lands of the Jordan valley (Ge 13:9 ff).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e3. History:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBethel was a royal city of the Canaanites (Jos 12:16). It appears to have been captured by Joshua (8:7), and it was allotted to Benjamin (Jos 18:22). In Jud 1:22 ff it is represented as held by Canaanites, from whom the house of Joseph took it by treachery (compare 1Ch 7:28). Hither the ark was brought from Gilgal (Jud 2:1, Septuagint). Israel came to Bethel to consult the Divine oracle (Jud 20:18), and it became an important center of worship (1Sa 10:3). The home of the prophetess Deborah was not far off (Jud 4:5). Samuel visited Bethel on circuit, judging Israel (1Sa 7:16).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith the disruption of the kingdom came Bethel's greatest period of splendor and significance. To counteract the influence of Jerusalem as the national religious center Jeroboam embarked on the policy which won for him the unenviable reputation of having \"made Israel to sin.\" Here he erected a temple, set up an image, the golden calf, and established an imposing ritual. It became the royal sanctuary and the religious center of his kingdom (1Ki 12:29 ff; Am 7:13). He placed in Bethel the priests of the high places which he had made (1Ki 12:32). To Bethel came the man of God from Judah who pronounced doom against Jeroboam (1Ki 13), and who, having been seduced from duty by an aged prophet in Bethel, was slain by a lion. According to the prophets Amos and Hosea the splendid idolatries of Bethel were accompanied by terrible moral and religious degradation. Against the place they launched the most scathing denunciations, declaring the vengeance such things must entail (Am 3:14; 4:4; 5:11 m; Am 9:1; Ho 4:15; 5:8; 10:5,8,15). With the latter the name Bethel gives place in mockery to Beth-aven. Bethel shared in the downfall of Samaria wrought by the Assyrians; and according to an old tradition, Shalmaneser possessed himself of the golden calf (compare Jer 48:13). The priest, sent by the Assyrians to teach the people whom they had settled in the land how to serve Yahweh, dwelt in Bethel (2Ki 17:28). King Josiah completed the demolition of the sanctuary at Bethel, destroying all the instruments of idolatry, and harr ying the tombs of the idolaters. The monument of the man of God from Judah he allowed to stand (2Ki 23:4,25). The men of Bethel were among those who returned from Babylon with Zerubbabel (Ezr 2:28; Ne 7:32), and it is mentioned as reoccupied by the Benjamites (Ne 11:31). Zechariah (Zec 7:2) records the sending of certain men from Jerusalem in the 4th year of King Darius to inquire regarding particular religious practices. Bethel was one of the towns fortified by Bacchides in the time of the Maccabees (1 Macc 9:50; Ant, XIII, i, 3). It is named again as a small town which, along with Ephraim, was taken by Vespasian as he approached Jerusalem (BJ, IV, ix, 9).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eW.

Locations/Ancient Locations (4283 placemarks and overlays)/Levant","PopupInfo":"A town in the lot of Ephraim where Israel assembled under Joshua at the close of the war of conquest (Jos 18:1). Here territory was allotted to the seven tribes who had not yet received their portions. A commission was sent out to \"describe the land into seven portions\"; this having been done, the inheritances were assigned by lot. Here also were assigned to the Levites their cities in the territories of the various tribes (Joshua 18-21). From Shiloh Reuben and Gad departed for their homes East of the Jordan; and here the tribes gathered for war against these two, having misunderstood their building of the great altar in the Jordan valley (Joshua 22). From Jud 18:31 we learn that in the period of the Judges the house of God was in Shiloh; but when the sanctuary was moved thither from Gilgal there is no indication. The maids of Shiloh were captured by the Benjamites on the occasion of a feast, while dancing in the vineyards; this having been planned by the other tribes to provide the Benjamites with wives without involving themselves in responsibility (21:21 ff). While the house of the Lord remained here it was a place of pilgrimage (1Sa 1:3). To Shiloh Samuel was brought and consecrated to God's service (1Sa 1:24). The sanctuary was presided over by Eli and his wicked sons; and through Samuel the doom of their house was announced. The capture of the ark by the Philistines, the fall of Hophni and Phinehas, and the death of the aged priest and his daughter-in-law followed with startling rapidity (1Sa 3; 4). The sanctuary in Shiloh is called a \"temple\" (1Sa 1:9; 3:3) with doorpost and doors (1Sa 1:9; 3:15). It was therefore a more durable structure than the old tent.It would appear to have been destroyed, probably by the Philistines; and we find the priests of Eli's house at Nob, where they were massacred at Saul's order (1Sa 22:11 ). The disaster that befell Shiloh, while we have no record of its actual occurrence, made a deep impression on the popular mind, so that the prophets could use it as an effective illustration (Ps 78:60; Jer 7:12:14; 26:6). Here the blind old prophet Ahijah was appealed to in vain by Jeroboam's wife on behalf of her son (1Ki 14:2,4), and it was still occupied in Jeremiah's time (Jer 41:5).\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eThe position of Shiloh is indicated in Jud 21:19, as \"on the north of Beth-el, on the east side of the highway that goeth up from Beth-el to Shechem, and on the south of Lebonah.\" This is very explicit, and points definitely to Seilun, a ruined site on a hill at the Northeast of a little plain, about 9 miles North of Beitin (Bethel), and 3 miles Southeast of Khan el-Lubban (Lebonah), to the East of the highway to Shechem (Nablus). The path to Seilun leaves the main road at Sinjil, going eastward to Turmus `Aya, then northward across the plain. A deep valley runs to the North of the site, cutting it off from the adjoining hills, in the sides of which are rock-hewn tombs. A good spring rises higher up the valley. There are now no vineyards in the district; but indications of their ancient culture are found in the terraced slopes around.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eThe ruins on the hill are of comparatively modern buildings. At the foot of the hill is a mosque which is going quickly to ruin. A little distance to the Southeast is a building which seems to have been a synagogue. It is called by the natives Jami` el-`Arba`in, \"mosque of the Forty.\" There are many cisterns.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eJust over the crest of the hill to the North, on a terrace, there is cut in the rock a rough quadrangle 400 ft. by 80 ft. in dimensions.

Ziph was fortified by Rehoboam (2Ch 11:8). The name also occurs in 1Ch 2:42; 4:16.

Mattuvata took advantage of the Hittites' weakness, establishing his own kingdom with Anemorium as its capital. His rule extended as far as Afyon, in central Anatolia. At the end of the 12th century BCE the area was occupied by a nomadic tribe that had come from across the Caucasus mountains. The tribe was called by the ancient Greeks the \"Wind people\" after whom the city was named. The exact reasons behind this name are lost in time.The most probable explanation however, is that they worshiped a god of wind, perhaps similar to the Greek Aeolus, as their main deity. Then the city came under the control of the Phoenicians again, and later Persians. In 333 BCE Alexander the Great brought this coast within his Macedonian Empire, and he was succeeded by Seleucids and then Ancient Romans. The coast was given by Mark Anthony to Cleopatra as a wedding present and Roman coins have been discovered in the course of excavation, dating to the years between Emperors Titus (79-81 CE) and Valevianus (253-259 CE). The Romans were succeeded by the

In 395 BCE Bing&ouml;l was part of Byzantium, who ruled here intermittently until the Arab invasion in 634 BCE.\n\nAfter the Islamization of the region in the 13th Century Turkish Emirates were established. One of them was the Rum Seljuks, that conquered Bing&ouml;l in 1230 CE. In 1243 CE the Ilkhanate conquered the area after they had defeated the Rum-Seljuks.

After 395 CE the town became part of the Eastern Roman Empire (Byzantine) and during the early Middle Ages was a bishop's see - and as Antiphellus is still a titular see."}},{"type":"Feature","id":1277,"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[40.749802740000064,37.817068320000033]},"properties":{"OBJECTID":1277,"Name":"Hacemi Use tepe","FolderPath":"Ancient Locations/Ancient Locations (4283 placemarks and overlays)/Anatolia","PopupInfo":""}},{"type":"Feature","id":1278,"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[34.561346860000072,38.946790990000068]},"properties":{"OBJECTID":1278,"Name":"Hacibektas Höyügü","FolderPath":"Ancient Locations/Ancient Locations (4283 placemarks and overlays)/Anatolia","PopupInfo":""}},{"type":"Feature","id":1279,"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[40.742653440000026,37.802917640000032]},"properties":{"OBJECTID":1279,"Name":"Hakemi Use","FolderPath":"Ancient Locations/Ancient Locations (4283 placemarks and overlays)/Anatolia","PopupInfo":""}},{"type":"Feature","id":1280,"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[31.421709710000073,41.28003595000007]},"properties":{"OBJECTID":1280,"Name":"Herakleia Pontike ?","FolderPath":"Ancient Locations/Ancient Locations (4283 placemarks and overlays)/Anatolia","PopupInfo":""}},{"type":"Feature","id":1281,"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[41.013592570000071,37.777808040000025]},"properties":{"OBJECTID":1281,"Name":"Hirbemerdon Tepe","FolderPath":"Ancient Locations/Ancient Locations (4283 placemarks and overlays)/Anatolia","PopupInfo":""}},{"type":"Feature","id":1282,"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[34.226825890000043,37.662498330000062]},"properties":{"OBJECTID":1282,"Name":"Hupishna","FolderPath":"Ancient Locations/Ancient Locations (4283 placemarks and overlays)/Anatolia","PopupInfo":""}},{"type":"Feature","id":1283,"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[32.49444907000003,37.86892282000008]},"properties":{"OBJECTID":1283,"Name":"Ikonion","FolderPath":"Ancient Locations/Ancient Locations (4283 placemarks and overlays)/Anatolia","PopupInfo":""}},{"type":"Feature","id":1284,"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[34.583189330000039,39.041635470000074]},"properties":{"OBJECTID":1284,"Name":"Ilicek Höyügü ?","FolderPath":"Ancient Locations/Ancient Locations (4283 placemarks and overlays)/Anatolia","PopupInfo":""}},{"type":"Feature","id":1285,"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[26.238646620000054,39.957275090000053]},"properties":{"OBJECTID":1285,"Name":"Ilios","FolderPath":"Ancient Locations/Ancient Locations (4283 placemarks and overlays)/Anatolia","PopupInfo":""}},{"type":"Feature","id":1286,"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[32.202281970000058,38.477603860000045]},"properties":{"OBJECTID":1286,"Name":"Imircik Höyüg","FolderPath":"Ancient Locations/Ancient Locations (4283 placemarks and overlays)/Anatolia","PopupInfo":""}},{"type":"Feature","id":1287,"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[32.235838860000058,36.319820410000034]},"properties":{"OBJECTID":1287,"Name":"Iotape","FolderPath":"Ancient Locations/Ancient Locations (4283 placemarks and overlays)/Anatolia","PopupInfo":""}},{"type":"Feature","id":1288,"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[36.157153940000057,36.853647980000062]},"properties":{"OBJECTID":1288,"Name":"Issos","FolderPath":"Ancient Locations/Ancient Locations (4283 placemarks and overlays)/Anatolia","PopupInfo":""}},{"type":"Feature","id":1289,"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[34.28806620000006,39.106249000000048]},"properties":{"OBJECTID":1289,"Name":"Kadinca Höyük ?","FolderPath":"Ancient Locations/Ancient Locations (4283 placemarks and overlays)/Anatolia","PopupInfo":""}},{"type":"Feature","id":1290,"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[39.702331290000075,38.243993810000063]},"properties":{"OBJECTID":1290,"Name":"Kalhana Höyügü","FolderPath":"Ancient Locations/Ancient Locations (4283 placemarks and overlays)/Anatolia","PopupInfo":""}},{"type":"Feature","id":1291,"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[33.786597030000053,39.362850620000074]},"properties":{"OBJECTID":1291,"Name":"Kaman-Kalehöyük","FolderPath":"Ancient Locations/Ancient Locations (4283 placemarks and overlays)/Anatolia","PopupInfo":"Kaman-Kalehöyük is a multi-period archaeological site in Kirsehir, Turkey, around 100km south east of Ankara.

The city was captured by Persians after they conquered Asia Minor, and was later captured by Alexander the Great.\nAfter the death of Alexander, the city remained in Egyptian hands from 209 BCE to 197 BCE, under the dynasty of Ptolemaios, and with the conclusion of the Apamea treaty, was handed over to the Kingdom of Rhodes, together with the other cities of Lycia. From 190 BCE to 160 BCE it remained under Rhodeian hegemony, but after 160 BCE it was absorbed into the Lycian confederacy under Roman rule. Phaselis, like Olympos, was under constant threat from pirates in the 1st century BCE, and the city was even taken over by the pirate Zekenites for a period until his defeat by the Romans.

Sagalassos was part of the region of Pisidia in the western part of the Taurus Mountains. During the Persian period, Pisidia became known for its warlike factions.\nSagalassos was one of the wealthiest cities in Pisidia when Alexander the Great conquered it in 333 BCE on his way to Persia. It had a population of a few thousand. After Alexander's death, the region became part of territories of Antigonus Monophthalmus, possibly Lysimachus of Thrace, the Seleucids of Syria and the Attalids of Pergamon. Archeological record indicates that locals rapidly adopted Hellenic culture.\nThe Roman Empire absorbed Pisidia after the Attalids and it became part of province of Asia. In 39 BCE it was handed out to Galatian client king Amyntas but after he was killed in 25 BCE, Rome turned Pisidia into the province of Galatia. Under the Roman Empire, Sagalassos became the important urban center of Pisidia, particularly favoured by the Emperor Hadrian, who named it the \"first city\" of the province and the center of the imperial cult.

A covered reservoir having a capacity of 600 cubic meters of water was constructed about the sixth century BCE. Later, the Stoa was built over the reservoir. The Stoa consisted of two rows of Doric columns with rooms for shops or lodgings in the rear.\nThe main settlement was on the middle terrace, consisting of a grid of parallel streets and residential blocks. On the lower terrace are found a Doric Temple, probably to Apollo; the Fountain House, with the Agora in front of it; and Peribolos of the Altars, which contained dedications to various deities.\nDuring the prehistoric period the area was inhabited by Mycenaean Greeks. The city itself was founded by the Dorians. The temple foundations were begun at least as early as the eighth century BC. The earthquake of 226 BCE destroyed the city and the temple.

However, in 423 BCE managed to acquire its sovereign, nevertheless this situation did not last long for the Athenians quickly suppressed the revolt. During the Peloponnesian War, Mende, Toroni and Skione were the main goals of the two combattants, Athenians and Spartans, in the area, specially after Brasidas,the Spartan general, raised an army of allies and helots and went for the sources of Athenian power in north Greece in 424 BCE. After the end of the war, Mende reacquired its independence.\nThe city tried to avoid Olynthian rule in the 4th century BCE, when the Chalkidician League was established and later the Macedonian

He writes that settlers from Andros and Chalcis arrived on the shore at the same time. The natives of Acanthus, seeing the crowd of settlers, became frightened and left the city. The settlers sent an explorer each to see what had happened and, as they approached the city and realized it was empty, ran to be the first to take over the land for their fellow countrymen. The Chalcidian was the fastest but the Andrian, seeing he was losing, stopped and threw his spear on the wall's gate, before his opponent arrived. A court case followed, which was won by the Andrians, because as they protested, they had just about taken over the city first."}},{"type":"Feature","id":1706,"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[23.846539520000078,40.820436150000035]},"properties":{"OBJECTID":1706,"Name":"Amphipolis","FolderPath":"Ancient Locations/Ancient Locations (4283 placemarks and overlays)/Aegean","PopupInfo":""}},{"type":"Feature","id":1707,"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[23.485763130000066,40.638946700000076]},"properties":{"OBJECTID":1707,"Name":"Apollonia of Mygdonia ?","FolderPath":"Ancient Locations/Ancient Locations (4283 placemarks and overlays)/Aegean","PopupInfo":"ap-o-lo'-ni-a (Apollonia): A town in Mygdonia, a district in Macedonia.

The city was named in honor of the mythological Greek hero Heracles. The epithet Lynkestis means \"the Land of the Lynx\" in Greek.\nHeraclea was a strategically important town during the Hellenistic period, as it was at the edge of Macedon's border with Epirus to the west, and to the non-Greek world to the north, until the middle of the 2nd century BCE, when the Romans conquered Macedon and destroyed its political power. The Romans divided Macedonia into 4 regions and Heraclea was in the fourth region. The main Roman road in the area, Via Egnatia went through Heraclea, and Heraclea was an important stop. The prosperity of the city was maintained mainly due to this road. Objects discovered from the time of Roman rule in Heraclea are: Votive monuments, a portico, thermae (baths), a theatre and town walls. In the early Christian period, Heraclea was an important Episcopal seat. Some of its bishops are mentioned in synods in Serdica and other nearby towns. From this period are the ensembles of the Small and Great (Large, Big) basilica. The Grave (Funeral) basilica with a necropolis is located east of the

One contained an undisturbed ship burial including a wealth of Anglo-Saxon artefacts of outstanding art-historical and archaeological significance, which are now held in the British Museum in London. Other sites before then had already produced significant finds, but many had been looted.\n\nSutton Hoo is of a primary importance to early medieval historians because it sheds light on a period of English history which is on the margin between myth, legend and historical documentation. Use of the site culminated at a time when Rædwald, the ruler of East Anglia, held senior power among the English people, and played a dynamic if ambiguous part in the establishment of Christian rulership in England; it is generally thought most likely that he is the person buried in the ship.

Since the last pre-Christian centuries, members of the Celtic tribe of the Treveri settled in the area of today's Trier.\nThe Romans under Julius Caesar first subdued the Treveri in 58 to 50 BCE. No later than 16 BCE, at the foot of the hill later christened the Petrisberg, upon which a military camp had been set up in 30 BCE and abandoned again a few months later, the Romans founded the city of Augusta Treverorum (\"City of Augustus in the land of the Treveri\"), which has a claim to being the oldest city in Germany. The honour of being named after the Emperor was one shared only by Augsburg and Augst in northern Switzerland. Following the reorganisation of the Roman provinces in Germany in 16 BCE, Emperor Augustus decided that the city should become the capital of the province of Belgica. Shortly before 100 CE, an amphitheatre was built, the signal sign of a city of any importance.\nTrier rose in importance during the Empire's third-century crisis, as the chief city of the province of Gallia Belgica From 271 to 274 CE, Trier was the second city of the breakaway Gallic Empire, at first under Postumus, who was proclaimed in Cologne, then under his ephemeral successor, Victorinus, who made his base at Trier, where he had rebuilt a large house with a mosaic proclaiming his position as tribune in Postumus' Gallic Praetorian Guard; the city served again as capital under the emperors Tetricus I and II. From the second half of the 3rd century onwards, Trier was the seat of an archbishopric; the first bishop being Eucharius. In the year 275 CE, the city was destroyed in an invasion by the Alamanni. Diocletian recognized the urgency of maintaining an imperial presence in the Gauls, and established first Maximian, then Constantius Chlorus as caesars at Trier; from 293 to 395 CE, Trier was one of the residences of the Western Roman Emperor in Late Antiquity, and its position required the monumental settings that betokened imperial government."}},{"type":"Feature","id":2480,"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[7.0485906800000748,46.880902900000081]},"properties":{"OBJECTID":2480,"Name":"Aventicum","FolderPath":"Ancient Locations/Ancient Locations (4283 placemarks and overlays)/Europe","PopupInfo":""}},{"type":"Feature","id":2481,"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[11.60955862000003,48.41916942000006]},"properties":{"OBJECTID":2481,"Name":"Bernstorf","FolderPath":"Ancient Locations/Ancient Locations (4283 placemarks and overlays)/Europe","PopupInfo":"A bronze-age fortification, the south-west corner of which was overbuilt with a medieval fortification"}},{"type":"Feature","id":2482,"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[11.063728450000042,51.277355710000052]},"properties":{"OBJECTID":2482,"Name":"Bilzingsleben","FolderPath":"Ancient Locations/Ancient Locations (4283 placemarks and overlays)/Europe","PopupInfo":"Paleolithic settlement of \u003ci\u003ehomo erectus\u003c/i\u003e."}},{"type":"Feature","id":2483,"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[10.962800770000058,49.030956530000026]},"properties":{"OBJECTID":2483,"Name":"Biriciana","FolderPath":"Ancient Locations/Ancient Locations (4283 placemarks and overlays)/Europe","PopupInfo":""}},{"type":"Feature","id":2484,"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[13.467016240000078,48.57430179000005]},"properties":{"OBJECTID":2484,"Name":"Boiodurum","FolderPath":"Ancient Locations/Ancient Locations (4283 placemarks and overlays)/Europe","PopupInfo":""}},{"type":"Feature","id":2485,"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[8.3595965200000251,49.629782550000073]},"properties":{"OBJECTID":2485,"Name":"Borbetomagus","FolderPath":"Ancient Locations/Ancient Locations (4283 placemarks and overlays)/Europe","PopupInfo":"The city has existed since before Roman times, when it was captured and fortified by the Romans under Drusus in 14 BCE.

The garrison developed into a small town with the regularized Roman street plan, a forum, and temples for the main gods Jupiter, Juno, Minerva (upon whose temple, as is usual, was built the cathedral) and Mars.\nRoman inscriptions and altars and votive offerings can be seen in the archaeological museum, along with one of Europe's largest collections of Roman glass. Local potters worked in the south quarter of the town. Fragments of amphoras show that the olive oil they contained had come from Hispania Baetica, doubtless by sea and then up the Rhine. At Borbetomagus, Gunther king of the Burgundians, set himself up as puppet-emperor, the unfortunate Jovinus, during the disorders of 411-13. The city became the chief city of the first kingdom of the Burgundians, who left few remains; however, a belt clasp from Worms-Abenheim is a museum treasure.

Locations/Ancient Locations (4283 placemarks and overlays)/Europe","PopupInfo":"In 44 BCE, ten years after the conquest of Gaul, Julius Caesar was assassinated and civil war erupted. According to the historian Dio Cassius, in 43 BCE, the Roman Senate ordered Munatius Plancus and Lepidus, governors of central and Transalpine Gaul respectively, to found a city for a group of Roman refugees who had been expelled from Vienne (a town about 30 km to the south) by the Allobroges and were encamped at the confluence of the Saône and Rhône rivers. Dio Cassius says this was to keep them from joining Mark Antony and bringing their armies into the developing conflict. Epigraphic evidence suggests Munatius Plancus was the principal founder of Lugdunum.\nLugdunum seems to have had a population of several thousand at the time of its founding. The citizens were administratively assigned to the Galerian tribe. The earliest Roman buildings were located on the Fourvière heights above the Saône river. The Aqueduct of the Gier, completed in the 1st century CE, was the first of four aqueducts supplying water to the city.\nWithin 50 years Lugdunum increased in size and importance, becoming the administrative centre of Roman Gaul and Germany. By the end of the reign of Augustus, Strabo described Lugdunum as the junction of four major roads: south to Narbonensis, Massilia and Italy, north to the Rhine river and Germany, northwest to the Ocean (the English Channel), and west to Aquitania.\nThe proximity to the frontier with Germany made Lugdunum strategically important for the next four centuries, as a staging ground for further Roman expansion into Germany, as well as the de facto capital city and administrative center of the Gallic provinces. Its large and cosmopolitan population made it the commercial and financial heart of the northwestern provinces as well."}},{"type":"Feature","id":2719,"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[2.3472373600000651,48.854981240000029]},"properties":{"OBJECTID":2719,"Name":"Lutetia","FolderPath":"Ancient
